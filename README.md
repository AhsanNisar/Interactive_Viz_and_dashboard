# Interactive Visualization and Dashboard
Belly Button Biodiversity
In this assignment, I've built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet.


Technologies

JavaScript,
Plotly.js,
html,
Python,
Flask,
Sqlite, and
Heroku

## Step 1 - Plotly.js

Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts for the dashboard.

PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (/samples/<sample>) to display the top 10 samples.

Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (/samples/<sample>) to display each sample.

Display the sample metadata from the route /metadata/<sample> in the page.

Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

Increased html column sizes to better fit pie chart and metadata table

## Step 2 - Flask API

Used Flask API starter code to serve the data needed for your plots.

## Step 3 - Heroku

Deployed the Flask app to Heroku.

Used the provided sqlite file for the database.
